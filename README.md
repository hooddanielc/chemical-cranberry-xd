# XD Mod

- Replaces grass crest shield texture with super hot and soggy XD image
- Replaces `YOU DIED` text with `LUL DAB`
- Add's LULDAB to shield of want texture

# Requirements

- iGP11

# How to Install

- Install iGP11 https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/28
- Copy  `tex_override` folder to your Dark Souls 3 installation, usually located here: 
    ```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\iGP11\tex_override
    ```
    If you already have a `text_override` folder, you may have already used `iGP11` and can safely merge those files. 
- Open iGP11 and configure it to point to your Dark Souls III installation, usually located here:
    ```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game
    ``` 
- Press **Launch Game** from iGP11 application

# Common Issues

- Game not started with iGP11 **Launch Game** button
- Textures will only show if plugin settings `rendering mode` is not set, (I use **effects** for `rendering mode`)
- Textures will not show unless texture settings `override mode` is not set to **override**

# Source

- Project was derived from [WhatsApp Shield (Grass Crest)](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/876?tab=files&file_id=3295) mod
- Half-ass modification created by dhoodlum
